### Redux / React Learning Project

This is a project I am using while learning Redux / React. The idea is a form that allows the user to
add multiple fields and their definitions.

### Django support for hot reloading

As I worked on this project, I realized I was jumping through coding hoops to mimic a REST API, rather than
just having a sample one. To best mimic the project I'm eventually going to add this to, I've turned this project
into a hybrid React/Redux/Django application. It supports hot loading from Django (though an additional node
server must be run).

### Installing

> These instructions also assume that you already have the latest node.js installed.
